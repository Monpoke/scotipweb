\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{What did we learn?}

This project was an opportunity to use framework such as Hibernate or Spring, massively used in the professional world.
It was a great experience both on the technical and human, we learnt to organise a big project inside the group
We learnt to develop a complex project from A to Z, it means, configure the development environment, configure servers, framework, work with multiple servers and providers...

\section{What could be improved?}

Our project is currently usable, we can create a complete switchboard and use it but we could develop more feature such as:

\begin{itemize}  
\item opening hours : You can left a voice mail message after some time
\item Text-To-Speech sentences (TTS): user can type a sentence which will be convert to a vocal message with an artificial voice
\end{itemize}  

More than develop the switchboard feature, we could develop our own SIP client, where operators can receive the calls directlry on their computer, where we could manage switchboard and view statistics...
