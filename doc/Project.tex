\chapter{About this project}

In a growing business world, lot of company needs a phone switchboard to allows their customers to contact them.  But smaller company or even private individuals can't afford these systems. They need lot of configuration and a good knowledge to configure them. 


Our goal has been to permit these small company and private individuals to create their own switchboard, without any knowledge how these systems work. Through an easy web interface, it becomes possible to create a basic telephone switchboard.

Our project, called \textit{ScotIP}, is fully open-source and available on \textit{GitHub}. This project consists of an association between three servers: the \textbf{website}, an \textbf{Asterisk} server and a \textbf{NodeJS} server.
