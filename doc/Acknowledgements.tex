\chapter{Acknowledgements}

{\large

Firstly we would like to thank the IUT, in particular Mr Lebegue, who was reading our weekly reports, for his support and his interest in our project and for giving us the opportunity to participate in an internship here in Glasgow. We highly appreciated our time working here, and it has been a really great experience for us.\newline 

Many thanks to Mr Eddie Gray who was our tutor at GCU and who encouraged us during all the time of this project. We are also grateful to Mr Hadi Larijan who looked at our project, and finally, Miss Gillian Anderson and Miss Heather Marshall for welcoming us at the \textit{GCU}.
\newline

For testing our project, we would like also to thanks our family and friends. Their interest were for us a great help.
