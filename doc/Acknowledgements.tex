\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Firstly we would like to thank the IUT, in particular Mr Lebegue,who was reading our weekly reports, for her support and his interest in our project and for giving us the opportunity to participate in an internship here in Glasgow. We highly appreciated our time working here and it has been a terrific experience.\newline

Many thanks to Mr Eddie Gray who was our tutor at GCU and who encouraged us during the project. We are really grateful to the GCU for welcoming us.\newline
