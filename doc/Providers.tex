\chapter{Providers}

\section{General remark}

For this project, we needed some providers for the different required technologies. We had to find a SIP provider and a private server to host our applications. 

\section{Server hosting}

Because we were already customer at \textit{OVH} before this internship, we used their services. We bought a tiny \textit{V.P.S.} \begin{tiny}(Virtual Private Server)\end{tiny} at a cheap cost. This server had these following specifications:
\begin{itemize}  
\item 2.4 GHz
\item 2 GB RAM
\item 10 GB SSD
\item OpenStack KVM technology
\end{itemize}



\section{SIP provider}

Because we made this project in Scotland, we needed to find a phone number located in Glasgow, to allows our tutors to call our service for free. We also used \textit{OVH} services which purposes the location of a phone number, located in Glasgow. 

We also found an other provider which purposes to receive calls for free. It was perfectly designed to our needs. Furthermore, this provider gives also the ability to call Skype account, something which was a really great thing for our project. So we chose to use the \textit{IPPI} service.
