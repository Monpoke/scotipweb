# ScotIP

*ScotIP* is a software which allows companies to create their own telephone switchboards.
A company can create a vocal service which welcome their clients with some Music On Holds, customs messages.
They can also manage calls forwarding or connect their own operators to our server.


This is a three month based project and it has been created by Pierre BOURGEOIS and Aur√©lien SVEVI, during an ERASMUS exchange between the University of Lille 1 (FRANCE) and the Glasgow Caledonian University (SCOTLAND).
